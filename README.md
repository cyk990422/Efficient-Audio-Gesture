# Efficient-Audio-Gesture

This is the official repository of the two papers. 

(ðŸ‘€ DIDiffGes elaborates on the process and inference of semi-implicit accelerated diffusion. This part plays a crucial role in the efficient generation of HoloGest.)

## 1. Getting started

This code was tested on `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti` and requires:

* conda3 or miniconda3

```
conda create -n EAG python=3.7
conda activate EAG
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## 2. Quick Start
Code coming soon !
