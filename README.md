# Efficient-Audio-Gesture

This is the official repository of the two papers. 

(üëÄ DIDiffGes elaborates on the process and inference of semi-implicit accelerated diffusion. This part plays a crucial role in the efficient generation of HoloGest.)

## 1. Getting started

This code was tested on `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti` and requires:

* conda3 or miniconda3

```
cd ./main/
bash pip_install.sh
```

## 2. Pre-trained model and data
- Download [CLIP](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CN9J2T1tN-F2R5qfHjOfMkGXP00oka6E?usp=drive_link) model , [ASR](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tvQQp6vacDcPg5T6WZIgWjvrk46nYin4?usp=sharing)and pre-trained weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14kH1QGBHaMLsdPIrNvEbgNnc32vfHK4U/view?usp=drive_link). Put all the folder in `./main/holgest/`.
- Download [TextEncoder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J39SDT3RwMH7v7dJl_53stb0wkwTbXEY?usp=drive_link) and put it in `./main/model/`
- Download WavLM weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1du41ziM0utAMjCtn-YPM8ZYOI6YplHrq?usp=drive_link) and put it in `./main/hologest`
